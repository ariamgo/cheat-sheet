### Set up passwordless SSH between 2 PCs

1. On local PC, generate new SSH key
```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```
Press enter to accept defaults.

If you are on Windows, your key is in C:/Users/User/.ssh

3. Copy key to remote computer
```bash
ssh-copy-id username@host_name
```
It‚Äôll prompt for PC2 password once. After that, you're in passwordlessly.

4. SSH like usually
```bash
ssh username@host_name
```
It shouldn't ask you for a password.

### Set up SSH for GitHub
1. On local PC, generate new SSH key
```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```
Press enter to accept defaults.

If you are on Windows, your key is in `C:/Users/User/.ssh`

2. Open the **public key** (`.pub`) and copy its contents
3. Got to GitHub $\rightarrow$ Settings $\rightarrow$ SSH and GPG keys $\rightarrow$ Add new key
4. Type a title (something to mark the specific computer) and paste in the key you copied

All set, now git remote should allow you to connect to your GitHub repos.

### Set up different key for each connection
You can use the same SSH key for all your remote connections, but it is reccommended to set up different keys for each connection for security.

1. Generate keys for each purpose, ie.
```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_github -C "your_email@example.com"
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_remote1 -C "remote1"
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_remote2 -C "remote2"
```

2. Add GitHub public key to GitHub ([instructions](#set-up-ssh-for-github))

3. Add each remote key's `.pub` to the respective PC using `ssh-copy-id`
```bash
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_remote1.pub username@remote1_ip
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_remote2.pub username@remote2_ip
```

4. Create (or edit) your `.ssh-config` file as follows:
```bash
# GitHub
Host github.com
  HostName github.com
  User git
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_github
  IdentitiesOnly yes

# Remote 1
Host remote1
  HostName remote1_ip
  User username
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_remote1
  IdentitiesOnly yes

# Remote 2
Host remote2
  HostName remote2_ip
  User username
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_remote2
  IdentitiesOnly yes
```
Now you can SSH all you want.

### Set up GitHub repos

There are 2 ways to set up a GitHub repo
1. Create a repo on GitHub and clone it locally
2. Create a repo locally and push it on GitHub

#### Create a repo on GitHub and clone it locally
1. Go to GitHub and create a repo. Name it and create a README.md. Oprionally select a
template for the .gitignore, licence and description.
2. Once the the repo is created, go to Code $\rightarrow$ SSH and copy the repo SSH link.
3. On your local PC go to the folder you want to clone the repo in and open cmd/bash.
4.`git clone link-you-copied`

Your repo is cloned and ready for commits.

### Create a repo locally and push to GitHub
Let's assume you have already created a repo, even made some commits already and want to
upload to GitHub.
1. Go to GitHub and create a repo. Name it the same as your local repo and **do not**
create a README.md (you already have one locally). You want your repo to be completely empty.
2. Once the the repo is created, go to Code $\rightarrow$ SSH and copy the repo SSH link.
3. Locally, on your cmd/bash do:
```bash
git remote add origin link-you-copied
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```
Your commits should be pushed to GitHub and your local repo is connected to the GitHub repo.

## üßπ Pre-commits

Pre-commits are scripts that run automatically before a commit is made. These can be used to ensure code quality by running linters, formatters, and other checks on the codebase.

### üîß Install & Set Up

```bash
poetry add pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

This adds the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file, where you define the hooks you want to run.

### üìÑ Example Configuration

Here's an example of a `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file:

```yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
    rev: v3.4.0
    hooks:
      - id: trailing-whitespace
      - id: end-of-file-fixer
      - id: check-yaml
  - repo: https://github.com/psf/black
    rev: 21.12b0
    hooks:
      - id: black
```

### üîÑ Usage

- Stage files you want to commit.
- Run all hooks against all files: `pre-commit run --all-files`
- Run hooks only on changed files: `pre-commit run`
- Update pre-commit hooks: `pre-commit autoupdate`
- If you run git commit with pre-commits and files are modified by hooks, commit will be
aborted. You need to:
    - Stage them again
    - Commit them

### ü™ù Linters

Analyze the code for syntax, style and potential bugs.
Catch issues like:
- Unused variables
- Wrong import order
- Missing docstrings
- 
### ü™ù Formatters

Automatically reformat code to follow a consistent style.
- Indentation
- Quote style
- Line breaks
- Comma placements

Linters and formatters get their config from `pyproject.toml`

### üìÑ Example Configuration

```toml
[tool.ruff]
exclude = ["docs"]
line-length = 88
target-version = "py311"

[tool.ruff.lint]
ignore = [
  # pylint
  # No pylints
  # ruff
  "RUF001",
  # flake8-bandit
  "S101",
  ...
  "ISC001",
  "N806",
  "N803",
  "SLF001"
]
select = ["ALL"]

[tool.ruff.lint.flake8-quotes]
inline-quotes = "double"

[tool.ruff.lint.pydocstyle]
convention = "numpy"
```

## üìù NumPy Docstrings

NumPy docstrings follow a specific format to ensure consistency and clarity. Here's a basic template for writing NumPy-style docstrings:

```python
def example_function(param1, param2):
    """
    Brief summary of the function.

    Extended description of the function, which can cover
    multiple lines and provide more detailed information.

    Parameters
    ----------
    param1 : int
        Description of the first parameter.
    param2 : str
        Description of the second parameter.

    Returns
    -------
    bool
        Description of the return value.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If `param1` is not a positive integer.

    See Also
    --------
    related_function : Description of related function.
    
    Notes
    -----
    Additional notes about the function, its usage, or implementation details.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> example_function(3, 'test')
    True
    """

    if param1 <= 0:
        raise ValueError("param1 must be a positive integer")
    # Example function logic
    return True
```

### Key Sections

- **Summary**: A one-line summary that starts with a capital letter and ends with a period.
- **Parameters**: A list of parameters with types and descriptions.
- **Returns**: Description of the return value, including type information.
- **Raises**: Any exceptions that the function may raise and the conditions under which they occur.
- **See Also**: References to related functions or methods within the module.
- **Notes**: Additional information about the function, which may include implementation details.
- **Examples**: Usage examples with the expected output, helpful for understanding function behavior.

# üìÑ Generating Documentation
 
 Assuming you already have numpy docstrings in your code.

1. Add necessary packages
```bash
poetry add --group docs numpydoc sphinx sphinx-rtd-theme sphinx-math-dollar myst-parser
```

- numpydoc: Parses NumPy-style docstrings for Sphinx.
- sphinx: Turns reStructuredText or Markdown + docstrings into HTML, LaTeX, PDF, etc.
- sphinx-math-dollar: Allows you to write math equations with LaTeX dollar signs (`$...$` for inline, `$$...$$` for block).
- sphinx-rtd-theme: The [ReadTheDocs theme](https://readthedocs.io/)
- myst-parser: Enables writing docs in Markdown `.md` instead of `.rst`

2. Set up sphinx in the docs folder of your repo
```bash
poetry run sphinx-quickstart docs
```
Follow prompts on the terminal.

3. Configure conf.py
For example
```
# -- General configuration ---------------------------------------------------

extensions = [
    "sphinx.ext.autosummary",
    "sphinx.ext.autodoc",
    "numpydoc",
    "sphinx_math_dollar",
    "sphinx.ext.mathjax",
    "sphinx_rtd_theme",
    "myst_parser",  # enables Markdown support via MyST
]

templates_path = ["_templates"]
exclude_patterns = []

autosummary_generate = True
numpydoc_class_members_toctree = False

# -- Options for HTML output -------------------------------------------------

html_theme = "sphinx_rtd_theme"

# -- Options for napoleon extension ------------------------------------------
napoleon_google_docstring = False
napoleon_numpy_docstring = True
```

4. Autogenerate `.rst` files for your code
```bash
sphinx-apidoc -o docs/source your_module
```

5. Include modules into `index.rst`
Include something like:
```rst
.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2
   :caption: API Reference

   your_module # don't forget the indent
```

6. üìö Build your documentation
```bash
sphinx-build -b html docs/source docs/build
```
