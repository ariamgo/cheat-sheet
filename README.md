## üßπ Pre-commits

Pre-commits are scripts that run automatically before a commit is made. These can be used to ensure code quality by running linters, formatters, and other checks on the codebase.

### üîß Install & Set Up

```bash
poetry add pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

This adds the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file, where you define the hooks you want to run.

### üìÑ Example Configuration

Here's an example of a `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file:

```yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
    rev: v3.4.0
    hooks:
      - id: trailing-whitespace
      - id: end-of-file-fixer
      - id: check-yaml
  - repo: https://github.com/psf/black
    rev: 21.12b0
    hooks:
      - id: black
```

### üîÑ Usage

- Run all hooks against all files: `pre-commit run --all-files`
- Run hooks only on changed files: `pre-commit run`
- Update pre-commit hooks: `pre-commit autoupdate`

### ü™ù Linters

Analyze the code for syntax, style and potential bugs.
Catch issues like:
- Unused variables
- Wrong import order
- Missing docstrings
- 
### ü™ù Formatters

Automatically reformat code to follow a consistent style.
- Indentation
- Quote style
- Line breaks
- Comma placements

Linters and formatters get their config from `pyproject.toml`

### üìÑ Example Configuration

```toml
[tool.ruff]
exclude = ["docs"]
line-length = 88
target-version = "py311"

[tool.ruff.lint]
ignore = [
  # pylint
  # No pylints
  # ruff
  "RUF001",
  # flake8-bandit
  "S101",
  ...
  "ISC001",
  "N806",
  "N803",
  "SLF001"
]
select = ["ALL"]

[tool.ruff.lint.flake8-quotes]
inline-quotes = "double"

[tool.ruff.lint.pydocstyle]
convention = "numpy"
```

## üìù NumPy Docstrings

NumPy docstrings follow a specific format to ensure consistency and clarity. Here's a basic template for writing NumPy-style docstrings:

```python
def example_function(param1, param2):
    """
    Brief summary of the function.

    Extended description of the function, which can cover
    multiple lines and provide more detailed information.

    Parameters
    ----------
    param1 : int
        Description of the first parameter.
    param2 : str
        Description of the second parameter.

    Returns
    -------
    bool
        Description of the return value.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If `param1` is not a positive integer.

    See Also
    --------
    related_function : Description of related function.
    
    Notes
    -----
    Additional notes about the function, its usage, or implementation details.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> example_function(3, 'test')
    True
    """

    if param1 <= 0:
        raise ValueError("param1 must be a positive integer")
    # Example function logic
    return True
```

### Key Sections

- **Summary**: A one-line summary that starts with a capital letter and ends with a period.
- **Parameters**: A list of parameters with types and descriptions.
- **Returns**: Description of the return value, including type information.
- **Raises**: Any exceptions that the function may raise and the conditions under which they occur.
- **See Also**: References to related functions or methods within the module.
- **Notes**: Additional information about the function, which may include implementation details.
- **Examples**: Usage examples with the expected output, helpful for understanding function behavior.
